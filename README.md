##&lt;github-icons&gt;

`github-icons` is like `iron-icons` but for the GitHub octicons, it's a simple fork from `iron-icons`

Example loading icon set:

```html
<link rel="import" href="../github-icons/github-icons.html">
```

To use an icon from one of these sets, prefix it with `github:` and then use the icon name. Check out the demo to see which ones are available.

```html
<iron-icon icon="github:watch"></iron-icon>
```

See [iron-icon](./iron-icon) for more information about working with icons.

See [iron-iconset](./iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](./iron-iconset-svg) for more information about how to create a custom iconset.
